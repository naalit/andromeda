# Andromeda

Andromeda will be a renderer for photorealistic, unbiased rendering both for production and hopefully games. Currently it runs into an infinite loop in a GLSL shader. So if you do run it, at the very LEAST, it will COMPLETELY FREEZE UP YOUR PC and youwill need to RESTART. Don't run it.
